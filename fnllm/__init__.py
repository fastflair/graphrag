"""Test stub for the optional fnllm dependency."""

# The real fnllm package provides helper factories that GraphRAG can use to
# talk to hosted models.  The test suite exercised in this repository only
# requires the module to exist so that imports succeed.  The lightweight
# shims below satisfy that requirement without introducing an additional
# dependency.
